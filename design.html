        <h2>Design and Development</h2>
        <p>I became interested in web design and development as a means to an end, namely understanding and improving our store's website: <a href="https://www.grothmusic.com" target="_blank" title="Visit grothmusic.com" rel="noopener">grothmusic.com</a>. Like the ecommerce sites of most small and mid-sized companies, grothmusic.com utilizes a third party shopping cart platform. The platform is proprietary, but in turn relies a variety of other frameworks (ASP.NET, Bootstrap), libraries (Jquery), and APIs (Google reCAPTCHA, Analytics, Web Fonts, etc.). It serves its purpose, but its one-size-fits-all design has limitations. As I tried to customize it to the unique needs of our classical sheet music business, I found it to be rigid, complex, bulky, secret, and, perhaps worst of all, slow.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the pandemic year, and with the help of a professional developer named Martin Cambronne, we have gradually made measurable progress on the speed, functionality, and design of our site. For me, a musician with no prior coding experience, this entailed learning HTML, CSS, a smattering of Javascript and JQuery, and the concepts behind ASP.NET MVC and SQL databases. I also had to learn the tools of the trade, namely VS Code, source control (Bitbucket), Inkscape for manipulating SVGs, WebPageTest and PageSpeed Insights for analyzing page load, Google Search Console and Analytics, Chrome DevTools, and so on.</p>
        <p>Improving the performance of grothmusic.com turned out to largely be an exercise in deconstruction, figuring out which aspects of the shopping cart platform were extraneous or redundant (or even nefarious) and then removing or reducing them without breaking anything. We also added new code for things like structured data, a better (and free) custom search, surfacing previously hidden data on category pages (composer!), and many other small but cumulatively important changes. Martin did the heavy lifting when it came to anything involving the database.</p>
        <p>The goal of my work became meeting Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds, their standards for page load speed, stability, and interactivity. Google measures website performance through the experience of real-world mobile and desktop Chrome users. For a site to meet Core Web Vitals thresholds, the standards must be met or exceeded on a 28-day rolling average. The metric that our site had the most trouble meeting was Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), the time it takes for the largest element on any given page to become visible to the user. LCP must average under 2.5 seconds. It took me two years or learning and tinkering, but in March of 2022 our site began passing. The key to improving page load came down to managing how, and how much, CSS and Javascript was loaded. Managing image size and delivery is also important.</p>
        <p>While working on the Groth site, web design has become a fun and useful hobby for me. It's a complimentary discipline to playing the clarinet: analog vs. digital, tradition vs. hyper-evolution, collaborative vs. solitary, physical vs. abstract.</p>
