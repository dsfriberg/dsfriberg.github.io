        <p>I am a clarinetist, retailer, and novice web developer living in Bloomington, Minnesota. I play and teach the clarinet on a freelance basis, manage the combined printed music departments of <a href="https://www.grothmusic.com" target="_blank" title="Visit grothmusic.com" rel="noopener">Groth and Eble Music Cos.</a>, and dabble in web design.</p>
        <h2>Clarinet</h2>
        <p>I have been playing the clarinet for more than 30 years. My focus during that time has been classical music, recently including early instruments. During the 2020-21 season I am acting principal clarinet of the <a href="https://www.dubuquesymphony.org/" target="_blank" title="Visit grothmusic.com" rel="noopener">Dubuque Symphony</a>. <a href="/bio.html">READ MORE</a></p>
        <h2 style="margin-block-end:.17em">My Book</h2>

            <div class="flex-item-left">
                <p><em>Clarinet Excerpts in Context</em> is made up of duets that encourage students to practice 12 of the most standard orchestral excerpts in a musical and collaborative setting. The first clarinet part is the solo line just as it appears in the literature, while the second part is a reduction of the orchestra that highlights the most important accompanimental rhythms and harmonies. The idea originated with Burt Hara, who encouraged his students to arrange duet like these and perform them in studio class. Includes commentary and tips for each excerpt.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>I became interested in web design and development as a means to an end, namely understanding and improving our store's website: <a href="https://www.grothmusic.com" target="_blank" title="Visit grothmusic.com" rel="noopener">grothmusic.com</a>. The design of this site, danfriberg.com, is inspired by a blog post by Steren Giannini that appeared in my feed: <a href="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My stack will outlive yours</a>. It's not an anti-design so much as a simple and indestructable design. My wife's reaction to it was, "Hm, 90s." I'm good with that for now. <a href="/design.html">READ MORE</a></p>
